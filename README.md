   - Store it securely using:

   ```python
   from google.colab import userdata
   GOOGLE_API_KEY = userdata.get("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
   genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
   ```

2. **📂 Run the Notebook:**
   - Open `📜 PromptPilot.ipynb` in 🖥 Jupyter Notebook or 🌍 Google Colab.
   - Follow the 📖 instructions in the notebook to ✨ generate and 🔍 refine code.

3. **🚀 Experiment with Prompts:**
   - Try different prompt structures to optimize AI responses.
   - Customize the AI system instructions to improve output relevance.
   - Use context-aware prompts for better and more accurate code generation.

## 📌 Usage

- **⚡ Basic Code Generation:**
  ```python
  gen_model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-2.0-flash")
  response = gen_model.generate_text("Write a Python function to sort a list.")
  print(response)
  ```

- **🚨 Error Handling & Debugging:**
  ```python
  error_prompt = "Explain why this Python error occurred and suggest a fix."
  error_model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-2.0-flash", system_instruction=error_prompt)
  ```

- **📜 Code Documentation Assistance:**
  ```python
  doc_prompt = "Generate documentation for the following Python function."
  doc_model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-2.0-flash", system_instruction=doc_prompt)
  ```

## 📌 Example Output

```
📥 Input: "Write a Python function to find the factorial of a number."
📤 Output: 

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

📖 *AI-generated documentation:*
```
This function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
:param n: Integer whose factorial is to be found.
:return: Factorial of the number.
```
